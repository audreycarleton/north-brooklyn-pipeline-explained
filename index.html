      <!--  <h1 class="georgia-font center"> National Grid is building a pipeline through Brooklyn. Here's everything you need to know.</h1> -->
      <p class="georgia-font center"> Public utility company National Grid is four-fifths of the way through construction on a pipeline that runs through predominantly Black and brown communities in North Brooklyn. But activists say it's not too late
        to stop
        it.

        <br>
        <br>The Metropolitan Reliability Infrastructure (MRI) project, more commonly known as the ‘North Brooklyn Pipeline’ would carry fracked gas through Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick, Williamsburg, and
        Greenpoint to a National Grid Depot on Newtown Creek. Construction for the pipeline began in 2017 — the first three phases have been completed, the fourth is currently underway, and community activists are fighting against the fifth, which
        National
        Grid has yet to receive approval on.
        The proposed fifth phase would cost $185-million in ratepayer funds to accomplish; the company is currently undergoing a rate case with the State to receive permission to hike New Yorkers’ fees pay for it.
        <br>
        <br> FrackTracker estimates show that nearly 200,000 New Yorkers reside within the evacuation zone of the pipeline, alongside a number of schools and 80 daycare centers. All of these Brooklyn residents would be at risk were the pipeline to
        leak or explode. But these at-risk
        residents are not those that are
        being served by the pipeline, many in opposition to it argue, including New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. In fact, living near oil and gas infrastructure is well-known to cause adverse health effects, including preterm birth,
        asthma, fatigue, migraines and chronic rhinosinusitis.

        The pipeline is also environmentally damaging: It's at risk of leaking methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes an estimated 86 times more to
        atmospheric warming than carbon dioxide.
